# 📖 Introduction

The aim of this project is to provide a web interface capable of displaying waiting times and traffic information for selected transport stations and lines in the Paris region. It replicates and adapts the design of PANAM signs, which are the latest generation of information displays used in stations. The project relies on the Île-de-France Mobilités PRIM API to retrieve the required data in real time.
